## Project Overview

Implemented an object detection system focused on human identification in videos:

- Utilized `PyTorch` for model inference and `OpenCV` for video processing.
- Applied Non-Max Suppression to refine detection predictions.
- Extracted statistics such as detection counts and model confidence.
- Monitored system performance using `psutil`.
